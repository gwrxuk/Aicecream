# Aiceream - Web3 Infrastructure Management System

A production-grade infrastructure management system for Web3 applications with Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) capabilities.

## Features

- Kubernetes-native infrastructure management
- Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) deployment and management
- Multi-cloud support (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- GitOps-driven deployment workflow
- Advanced monitoring and observability
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Cost optimization and resource management
- Web3 infrastructure automation
- Container orchestration and management
- Network and security management

## Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **API Gateway**: Handles all incoming requests and routes them to appropriate services
- **Infrastructure Controller**: Manages Kubernetes clusters and cloud resources
- **Rollup Manager**: Handles RaaS deployments and configurations
- **Monitoring System**: Collects metrics and provides observability
- **Cost Optimizer**: Manages resource allocation and cost optimization
- **Security Manager**: Handles authentication, authorization, and security policies

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75 or later
- Kubernetes cluster (v1.28 or later)
- PostgreSQL 15 or later
- Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring
- Access to cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure)
